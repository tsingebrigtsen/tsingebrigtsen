Working with numerical algorithms for molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations and 
simulations of supercooled liquids and glasses.

Lead-developed high-performance GPU code in CUDA C++ for millisecond MD computer simulations 
(RUMD project). Experience with CUDA implementation of Monte Carlo, Langevin, free-energy 
calculations, constant pressure, rigid-bonds in molecules, Gay-Berne rigid liquid crystals, 
and nanoconfinement.

Interests: 
C++, CUDA. Performance optimizations, scientific computing, library development, and more.
